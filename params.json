Additionally, the whole ALM including the often neglected and **underestimated longer-lasting maintenance/operating post-phase is a major focus in our approach**. We try to keep ourselves continuously up to date with common sense in best practices and proven concepts in technology and management by attending IT and Management conferences and studying relevant and contemporary literature in German, English and Portuguese.\r\n\r\n# Who we are\r\n> people are more important than tools\r\n\r\n## Eduard van den Bongard\r\n![Eduard van den Bongard](https://www.xing.com/image/8_2_0_a1d167a24_3293711_1/eduard-van-den-bongard-foto.256x256.jpg)\r\n> [email](mailto:eduard.van.den.bongard@dersalvador.com)\r\n> A full stack entrepreneur equipped with a versatile and rarely found combination of outstanding management and deep technical skills based on many years hands-on experience in the financial and telecommunication sector.\r\n\r\n## Michael Santana Mellouk\r\n![Michael Mellouk Santana](https://www.xing.com/image/e_f_8_f8268f56f_3487760_6/michael-roepke-foto.256x256.jpg)\r\n> [email](mailto:michael.santana.mellouk@dersalvador.com)\r\n> An old and new school software developer who managed to keep the curiosity of a child when disruptive technologies emerge and take humanity to the next evolutionary mindset. A very first xTreme-Programmer (predecessor of agile development) by Kent Beck and a dedicated spiritualist of pure and reliable coding.\r\n\r\n## David Richter\r\n![David Richter](https://www.xing.com/image/e_c_2_2bcd302c2_7439453_7/david-richter-foto.256x256.jpg)\r\n> [email](mailto:david.richter@dersalvador.com)\r\n> David belongs to the new generation of open-minded and revolutionary software developers with mental and geographical flexibility. He is our Missing Link to the emerging ideas and concepts coming from society's youth.\r\n\r\n## Norma Santana\r\n![Norma Santana](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAPKAAAAJDNhMDZmZDU3LWJhN2MtNGRjNC04ZjQ1LTBlZTM3MWU0NjE2YQ.jpg)\r\n> [email](mailto:norma.santana@dersalvador.com)\r\n> As a Brazilian native Norma helps us to extend our initiative to South-America, where the company name and the idea was born.\r\n\r\n# The Missing Link\r\n\r\nAs DevOps is meant to be a cultural rather than a technical transformation we realized that in the implementation diversities of respective solutions an essential and time-consuming part is missing which has been left out because more of its cultural than its technical impact. Affected sectors are those which heavily rely on external software suppliers delivering neutral versions of software needed to be customized and deployed on-premise because of segregation of responsibilities, confidential and audition policies. Especially the financial sector is affected and not affine to go for a cloud based solution or other DevOps innovation in the near future. To fully implement **the missing link** between the supplier(vendor) and the client a combination of disruptive and old technologies challenges today's skill-sets. We **successfully implemented** a solution to amend and automate in a **generic and almost industrially standardized** way the communication between the vendor and the consumer to **enable a full end-2-end application deployment automation incl. infrastructure and configuration management**.\r\n\r\n# Open Source Alliance (_MissingLinkProcessor_)\r\nTo contribute to the DevOps open source movement of which we already have benefited a lot, we disclose the essential part in our approach called the _MisingLinkProcessor_. This micro-service fills the gap between the external vendor and the internal consumer processes (client) by establishing a generic DSL in XML Format and a corresponding processor allowing a full automated integration including part of computable Release Notes.\r\n\r\n[The MissingLink Protocol on GitHub](https://github.com/DerSalvador/MissingLinkProcessor)\r\n\r\n# Collaborators \r\n## Andreas Kohler\r\n![Andreas Kohler](https://www.xing.com/img/users/1/e/4/e46ce00f7.7330256,4.256x256.jpg)\r\n> [email](mailto:andreas.kohler@dersalvador.com)\r\n> Combining the experience of almost two decades of Application Management, Configuration and Change Management in the Financial Services Industries.
